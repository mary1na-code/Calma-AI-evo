# Calma AI 🎧📚

Welcome to the public repository for **Calma AI** — a mobile‑first corrective special education and speech therapy project.  
Our mission is to help teens with **resolved or aided early hearing loss** rebuild missed auditory and phonological foundations so they can speak clearly, read fluently, and comprehend with confidence.

---

## 🌟 Vision

Calma AI is not a generic literacy app.  
It is designed specifically for learners who:
- Experienced temporary or early hearing loss  
- Still struggle with sound recognition, articulation, and reading comprehension  

By strengthening **phonemic awareness**, **sound–symbol mapping**, and **guided speech practice**, Calma AI tackles the root cause of these challenges rather than only treating surface‑level reading difficulties.

## 🔑 Core Loop

The heart of Calma AI is simple and focused:

1. **Listen** — Short auditory tasks to distinguish key speech sounds.  
2. **Practice Speech** — Guided word/phrase practice using the same sounds. 
3. **Get Feedback** — Immediate clarity on accuracy, with nudges to retry or advance.  
4. **Track Progress** — Minimal but motivating indicators (sessions completed, accuracy trends).

## 🚫 Non‑Goals

To stay focused, Calma AI will **not**:
- Serve as a general language learning or exam‑prep tool  
- Diagnose or treat medical hearing conditions  
- Support unrelated learning difficulties not rooted in auditory gaps  
- Become a full telehealth platform for therapists

## 🤝 Contributing

This repo shares **progress and transparecy**.  
Core development happens privately, but we welcome collaboration ideas and feedback — especially from educators, speech therapists, and accessibility advocates.
